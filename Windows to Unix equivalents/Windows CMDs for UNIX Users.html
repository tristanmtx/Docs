<b>UNIX users moving to Windows 2000/XP are often unaware of just how powerful this
operating system is.</b>
This is a brief and incomplete guide to help them get oriented,
with an emphasis on systems-related topics that ordinary Windows users can often ignore.

<a name="OSHIST"><h3>Operating system history</h3></a>
UNIX originated at Bell Labs around 1972 and was distributed beginning in 1978.
LINUX is Linus Torvalds' free version of UNIX derived 
from the <a href="http://www.gnu.org">Gnu project</a>.
<P>
It is <b>important to distinguish</b> the three different Windows product lines:
<ul>
<li><b>Windows 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, and 3.1,</b> a graphical user interface for DOS that grew
until it almost became a separate operating system.
<P>
<li><b>Windows NT, 2000, and XP,</b> a multitasking operating system 
derived from the Microsoft/IBM OS/2 project (though the code is not derived 
from OS/2, despite similarities).
Windows NT was originally architected by Dave Cutler, designer of VAX/VMS.
<P>
<li><b>Windows 95, 98, and ME,</b> a compromise between the two products, distinctly less reliable
but compatible with DOS device drivers (which the NT line isn't).
</ul>
In my opinion, <b>only the NT/2000/XP product line is the real thing,</b> and that's what
this document is about.
<P>
<b>Windows is bigger, newer, and more elaborate than UNIX.</b>
The days of DOS are long gone, but there are still people who 
don't realize Windows is a fully multitasking, virtual-memory
operating system, and some who aren't even aware that it has a command
prompt.

<hr>
<h3>Different architectures</h3>
When UNIX was invented, recursion was an exciting new concept, and structured programming was
just getting started.  Internally, UNIX relies on arrays and text files as its fundamental
data structures.
<P>
Windows is built on considerably newer technology.
Object orientation and default inheritance pervade it.
For example, file and directory permissions are inherited from the parent directory.
<P>
Also, under UNIX you can only assign file permissions to everyone, group members, or the file
owner.  Under Windows you manipulate Access Control Lists (ACLs) which let you assign permissions
to any user, set of users, computer, or combination thereof.
<P>
UNIX system administration requires the sysadmin to memorize, or look up, a large number
of arbitrary codes, file names, and the like.
Windows system administration is largely menu-driven.
<P>
UNIX is written in C, a programming language in which arrays are not bounds-checked.
Crackers exploit this fact to insert their own executable code by overrunning input buffers.
Windows was originally written in C and C++ but is moving toward a new software environment,
called the .NET Framework, in which Java-like JIT compilation is combined with automatic
error checking (to prevent overruns and uninitialized variables) and fully object-oriented
systems programming.

<hr>
<a name="SECURITY"><h3>Security</h3></a>
It is often claimed that Windows is harder to keep secure than UNIX.
My experience has been the opposite, partly because a Windows system normally offers less for
the outside user to break into.  (For instance, Telnet service is
normally turned off, and many of the functions of the machine simply
aren't available from outside.)
To keep Windows secure:
<ul>
<li>Don't log in with administrator privileges if you don't have to.
Make yourself a non-administrator account for everyday use.  That greatly limits the damage
a virus can do.<P>
<li>Use NTFS, not FAT or FAT32 (DOS-compatible) filesystems.  To convert a disk to NTFS, use
a command such as:<br>
<tt>convert c: /fs:ntfs</tt>
<P>
<li>Set reasonable permissions on all files and directories. Do not give "write" or "full control"
permission to "Everyone" unless you have a good reason.
<P>
<li>Run antivirus software and <i>keep it up to date</i>.
<P>
<li>Use Microsoft's Windows Update facility (built in) and <i>keep it up to date</i> (or even
use the newer Automatic Updates option).
<P>
<li>If you run IIS (the HTTP and FTP server), run URLSCAN (available free from Microsoft) to
block abnormal or suspicious HTTP requests.
</ul>

<hr>
<a name="ESSENTIAL"><h3>Essential Windows skills</h3></a>
<P>
To get to a command prompt, look under Start, Programs, Accessories.
(It is wise to put shortcuts to the Command Prompt in lots of convenient places.)
<P>
To adjust the properties of almost any object, right-click on it and choose Properties.
<P>
To select any object, left-click on it.<br>
<P>
To select multiple objects, select the first one, then 
hold down Ctrl while clicking on each of the others.
<P>
To select a whole range of objects, select the first,
then hold down Shift while selecting the last.
<P>
Many Windows program display tables which you can sort by clicking on
the headings (e.g., Name).
That's how to sort files by name or type, sort e-mail messages by name or date, and so on.
<P>
Usual editing shortcuts:<br>
Ctrl-C to copy to clipboard;<br>
Ctrl-X to cut (copy to clipboard and delete);<br>
Ctrl-V to paste from clipboard.<br>
