<strong><u>Changes and New Features</u></strong>
</p>
<ol class="NumberedList">
<li><span class="SectionTitle">Performance Improvements</span>:<br>
	<p>
		The performance improvements in Nagios Core 4 come primarily 
		from the following areas:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<span class="SectionTitle">Core Workers</span> - 
			<a href="#workers">Core workers</a> are lightweight 
			processes whose only job is to perform checks. Because 
			they are smaller they spawn much more quickly than 
			the the old process which forked the full Nagios Core. 
			In addition, they communicate with the main Nagios Core 
			process using in-memory techniques, eliminating the 
			disk I/O latencies that could previously slow things 
			down, especially in large installations.
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="SectionTitle">Configuration Verification</span> - 
			Configuration verification has been improved so that each 
			configuration item is verified only once.  Previously 
			configuration verification was an O(n<sup>2</sup>) operation.
			<!-- Commit a43493a098c467c5e8cd5a5f525d2f466a4b73b5 -->
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="SectionTitle">Event Queue</span> -
			The event queue now uses a data structure that has O(log n) 
			insertion times versus the O(n) insertion time previously. 
			This means that inserting events into the queue uses much less
			CPU than in Nagios Core 3.
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="SectionTitle">Macro Resolution</span> - 
			Macros are now sorted on startup so macro lookup can use a 
			binary search. 
			<!-- Commit 4b8877ca7b438984d4cd16b2a819e9fcf85ebc06 -->
			In addition, frequently accessed macros $USERx$, $ARGx$, and
			$HOSTADDRESS$ are given special case, early lookups.
			<!-- Commit c56c1373d17db228041fea6f52d4091bd8cca798 -->
		</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li><span class="SectionTitle">Object Definitions</span>:<br>
	<p>
		The following changes have been made to object definitions:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			The host <a href="objectdefinitions.html#host">address</a> 
			attribute is now optional. The address attribute is set 
			to the host name when it is absent. Most configurations 
			set the host name attribute to the DNS host name making 
			the address attribute redundant. 
			<!-- Commit 3c1f91cf9c26ad2036bfb4476f61e9eaca3f51cd -->
		</li>
		<li>
			Both <a href="objectdefinitions.html#host">hosts</a> and 
			<a href="objectdefinitions.html#service">services</a> now
			support an hourly value attribute. The hourly value
			attribute is intended to represent the value of a host or 
			service to an organization and is used by the new 
			minimum value contact attribute.
			<!-- Commit 9cb6e77a6b74f51e01ea873861e79da55f2c808a -->
		</li>
		<li>
			Services now support a <a href="objectdefinitions.html#service">
			parents</a> attribute. A service parent performs a function 
			similar to host parents and can be used in place of 
			<a href="objectdefinitions.html#servicedependency">service
			dependencies</a> in simple circumstances.
			<!-- Commit 9cb6e77a6b74f51e01ea873861e79da55f2c808a -->
		</li>
		<li>
			The failure_prediction_enabled flag has been removed from 
			both host and service object definitions.
			<!-- Commit 3050336c38033491cace68f105c4b8dd0fe8ee6b -->
		</li>
		<li>
			<a href="objectdefinitions.html#contact">Contacts</a> now 
			support a minimum value attribute. The mininum value attribute
			is used with the host and service hourly value attributes
			to determine whether to notify a contact on host and service
			problems. <!-- Commit 9cb6e77a6b74f51e01ea873861e79da55f2c808a -->
		</li>
		<li>
			The host obess_over_host and the service obsess_over_service 
			attributes can now both use the shortened attribute obsess.
			<!-- Commit 79b7c2a3ccea32e36d1163ee7273799b007c90ae -->
		</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li><span class="SectionTitle">Object Behavior</span>:<br>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Contact Inheritance</b> - 
			According to the documentation, contacts should only be 
			inherited from host to service if the service has no other 
			contacts whatsoever (and the same goes for escalations), 
			but the way the code previously worked was that it handled 
			contact_groups and contacts directives separately, meaning 
			services with only 'contacts' specified were still eligible 
			for inheriting 'contact_groups' from the host. This has been
			updated to comply with the documentation.
			<!-- Commit 01621635b394018ba9a5cd439eca407549f0319d -->
		</li>
		<li><b>Timeperiods</b> - 
			There were several issues processing timeperiods when
			both exclusions and exceptions were involved. The issues
			have been corrected.
			<!-- Commit adc39a62862555065d28546e0549af9064bf6a61 -->
		</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li><span class="SectionTitle">Configuration</span>:<br>
	<p>
		The following changes have been made to the main Nagios 
		Core configuration, nagios.cfg:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Because there are many ways to obtain object information, 
			the object information is no longer stored if in the 
			object cache if the configuration variable 
			<a href="configmain.html#object_cache_file">object_cache_file</a>
			equals '/dev/null'. Setting the variable to '/dev/null' will
			reduce the disk I/O load.
			<!-- Commit fde258615ae70d3101c64854aec41cd2a71e2b72 -->
		</li>
		<li>
			Because there are many ways to obtain status information, 
			the status information is no longer stored if in the 
			status data file if the configuration variable 
			<a href="configmain.html#status_file">status_file</a>
			equals '/dev/null'. Setting the variable to '/dev/null' will
			reduce the disk I/O load.
		</li>
		<li>
			There is a new configuration variable, 
			<a href="configmain.html#log_current_states">log_current_states</a>,
			which determines whether current states will be logged in
			the log files when they are rotated. In Nagios Core 3, this
			was always the behavior and it is the default in Nagios 
			Core 4. Disabling the logging of current states on 
			log rotation can save considerable disk space for large
			installations.
			<!-- Commit a7c7d30987ad549b406b3727f149a6034011e1f4 -->
		</li>
		<li>
			There is a new configuration variable, 
			<a href="configmain.html#check_workers">check_workers</a>,
			which specifies how many worker processes are created 
			when Nagios Core starts. If not specified, the number of 
			worker process is determine by the number of CPUs on 
			the system.
			<!-- Commit 80aaa2efdfc1c0bc6249fd4025276e538d9a525b -->
		</li>
		<li>
			There is a new configuration variable, 
			<a href="configmain.html#query_socket">query_socket</a>,
			which specifies the location of the <a href="#qh">query
			handler</a> socket. The default location is 
			/usr/local/nagios/var/rw/nagios.qh.
			<!-- Commit eb8870c8129d988e87fa563ec2a4eeb9055a72a6 -->
		</li>
		<li>
			The configuration variables, 
			<a href="configmain.html#check_result_reaper_frequency">
			check_result_reaper_frequency</a>
			and <a href="configmain.html#max_check_result_reaper_time">
			max_check_result_reaper_time</a>, have been deprecated. 
			Because of the new worker architecture, checks are no 
			longer reaped, but they are fed back to core by the
			worker processes. As a result, these variables no longer
			make sense.
			<!-- Commit 75279992cc47cdf56b4f527e6ffe81eeafcbc25b -->
		</li>
		<li>
			All file and directory configuration variables in the main
			nagios.cfg can now use paths that are relative to the 
			location of nagios.cfg. 
			<!-- Commit 9eb0602ce6e726196a45e2170fa4f5162e7eb61e -->
		</li>
		<li>
			Although rarely used in the past, creating nagios objects
			in the main nagios.cfg configuration file was allowed. This
			is now prohibited.
		</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li><span class="SectionTitle">Macros</span>:<br>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Additions</b> - 
			A new macro, $CHECKSOURCE$, has been added which contains
			information about what process performed a check. 
		</li>
		<li><b>Changes</b> - 
			If <a href="configmain.html#use_large_installation_tweaks">use_large_installation_tweaks</a> is set, 
			the $HOSTGROUPMEMBERS$ and $SERVICEGROUPMEMBERS$
			macros are no longer exported because they can 
			consume the available space for environment variables.
			<!--Commit d98852b09b5bfd6b11675ccd5f2c0f022efb81fa-->
		</li>
		<li>
			Macros are normally available as environment variables when 
			check, event handler, notification, and other commands are run.
			This can be rather CPU intensive in large Nagios installations, 
			so you can disable the export of environment variables completely
			with the <a href="configmain.html#enable_environment_macros">enable_environment_macros</a> option.
		</li>
		<li>Macro information can be found <a href="macros.html">here</a>.</li>

	</ul>
</li>
<a name="qh"/>
<li><span class="SectionTitle">Query Handler</span>:<br/>
	<p>
		The query handler is a general purpose communication mechanism 
		that allows external entities to communicate with Nagios Core 
		in a well-defined manner.
		<!-- Commit 5267bf2c0375e6a42a6ef9721f74d6c1b615013f -->
		As of this writing, all communication 
		with the query handler takes place through a Unix-domain socket
		whose location is defined by the 
		<a href="configmain.html#query_socket">query_socket</a>
		configuration variable.
	</p>
	<p>
		There are currently 5 built-in query handlers.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>core</b> - provides Nagios Core management and information</li>
		<li><b>wproc</b> - provides worker process registration, management
			and information</li>
		<li><b>nerd</b> - provides a subscription service to the 
			<a href="#nerd">Nagios Event Radio Dispatcher (NERD)</a></li>
		<li><b>help</b> - provides help for the query handler</li>
		<li><b>echo</b> - implements a basic query handler that simply
			echoes back the queries sent to it</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		More information about the query handler interface, including
		an introduction to creating a custom query handler, can be found
		in the source-supplied <a href="#docs">documentation</a>.
	</p>
</li>
<a name="workers"/>
<li><span class="SectionTitle">Core Workers</span>:<br>
	<p>
		Previously, all host and service checks were performed by 
		the full Nagios Core process. This required forking the Nagios 
		Core process for every check. The full Nagios Core process
		includes a lot of things that are not required to actually
		perform the check, including check scheduling, downtime
		handling, processing external commands, etc. As a result, 
		forking the Nagios Core process was much slower than was 
		necessary. When the actual check was run, the forked process
		again forked a shell to run the check and the shell forked
		to run the plugin.
	</p>
	<p>
		In addition, disk files were used as the inter-process 
		communication (IPC) mechanism between the forked Nagios 
		process doing the checking and the main Nagios process 
		handling the check results.
	</p>
	<p>
		In Nagios Core 4, the process of performing host and service 
		checks is now accomplished using a lightweight worker processes.
		Standard worker processes start up with the main Nagios Core
		process and additional, special-purpose workers, can be started
		at any time after Nagios Core starts. If the check command is
		"simple" (no shell escapes), the worker process can run the
		command directly, avoiding the 2 additional forks previously
		required.
	</p>
	<p>
		Also in Nagios Core 4, the worker processes report the check
		results to the main Nagios Core process using in-memory IPC
		mechanisms (the <a href="#qh">query handler</a> interface), 
		eliminating the disk I/O bottleneck that used to be an issue 
		in large installations.
	</p>
	<p>
		When a worker process registers with the main Nagios Core 
		process, it tells Nagios Core what checks it will handle. 
		This feature allows external authors to create special-purpose
		workers which are optimized to perform certain checks.
		A sample special-purpose ping check worker is included with
		the Nagios Core source code in the worker/ping subdirectory.
	</p>
	<p>
		More information about workers, including an introduction 
		to creating custom workers can be found in the source-supplied 
		<a href="#docs">documentation</a>.
	</p>
</li>
<a name="nerd"/>
<li><span class="SectionTitle">Nagios Event Radio Dispatcher (NERD)</span>:<br/>
	<p>
		The Nagios Event Radio Dispatcher (NERD) is a 
		<a href="#qh">query handler</a> based service that streams
		Nagios Core events to the subscriber. Currently, there
		are three channels that can be subscribed to: hostchecks, 
		servicechecks and opathchecks.
	</p>
	<!-- Commit 5eaf9e07aec54c2cc1acdf3fc494954a75bfc72d -->
</li>
<li><span class="SectionTitle">libnagios</span>:<br/>
	<p>

		developers of query handlers and worker processes. libnagios
		currently contains the following components.

	    <li><b>worker</b> - 
			for utils and stuff nifty to have if you're a worker</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<a name="docs"/>
<li><span class="SectionTitle">Documentation</span>:<br/>
	<p>
		Documentation of Nagios Core internals is now provided as part
		of the source distribution. To create an HTML version of this
		documentation run 'make dox' from the root of the source
		distribution tree. The doxygen utilities must be installed to
		make this documentation.
	</p>
</li>
<li><span class="SectionTitle">Tests</span>:<br/>
	<p>
		A much more complete test suite is now incuded with the 
		Nagios Core source distribution.
	</p>
</li>
<li><span class="SectionTitle">RPM Spec File</span>:<br/>
	<p>
		The RPM spec file has been completely overhauled to support
		more current standards. 
	</p>
</li>
<li><span class="SectionTitle">Deprecated Features</span>:<br>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Extended Host and Service Information</b> - 
			The <a href="objectdefinitions.html#hostextinfo">hostextinfo</a>
			and <a href="objectdefinitions.html#serviceextinfo">serviceextinfo</a>
			objects are now deprecated and should not be used. Support
			for them will be removed in a future version. The same
			information specified in the hostextinfo and serviceextinfo
			objects can be specified in the host and service object
			respectively.
			<!-- Commit 0c8b06251ce03a4c495fe9388d2d8434901a3120 -->
		</li>
		<li><b>-x/--dont-verify-paths command line option (Don't check for circular object paths)</b> - 
			Because configuration checking is now so much faster, the
			option to skip checking for circular object paths has 
			been deprecated.
			<!-- f3b052eeb30fa29b5eda50cdd4d4ac0b3b17226d -->
		</li>
		<li>
			The following configuration variables have been deprecated:
			<a href="configmain.html#check_result_reaper_frequency">check_result_reaper_frequency</a>, 
			<a href="configmain.html#max_check_result_reaper_time">max_check_result_reaper_time</a>,
			<a href="configmain.html#sleep_time">sleep_time</a>, 
			<a href="configmain.html#external_command_buffer_slots">external_command_buffer_slots</a>, 
			<a href="configmain.html#command_check_interval">command_check_interval</a>
		</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li><span class="SectionTitle">Obsoleted Features</span>:<br/>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Failure Prediction</b> - 
			As noted above, the failure_prediction_enabled flag has 
			been removed from both host and service object definitions.
			Failure predition was never fully implemented and would 
			require breaking the paradigm that Nagios Core knows 
			nothing about the performance data returned by plugins.
			Failure prediction is much more approprately handled by 
			an add-on than by Nagios Core.
		</li>
		<li><b>-o/--dont-verify-objects command line option</b> -
			This option, while accepted in Nagios Core 3, has neither
			been advertized nor has had any effect for quite some 
			time. The option has been removed in Nagios Core 4.
			<!-- Commit f3b052eeb30fa29b5eda50cdd4d4ac0b3b17226d -->
		</li>
		<li><b>Embedded Perl</b> - 
			Embedded Perl has historically been the least tested and
			the most problem prone part of Nagios Core. A significant
			part of the issue is that there are so many versions of
			Perl available. The performance enhancements provided by 
			the new worker process architecture make up for any
			performance loss due to the removal of embeddd Perl. In
			addition, the worker process architecture makes possible
			the implementation of a special purpose worker to
			persistently load and run Perl plugins. The following
			configuration variables that were related to embedded Perl
			have been obsoleted: use_embedded_perl_implicitly,
			enable_embedded_perl, p1_file.
		</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li><span class="SectionTitle">Miscellaneous</span>:<br/>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Object IDs</b> - 
			Primarily only of interest to developers, all of the 
			first-class objects now have object IDs.  First-class 
			objects are timeperiod, command, contact, host, service, 
			escalations, dependencies and all kinds of groups. Object
			IDs are not persistent and are recreated on each restart.
